3. made terrain to look like the agreed upon hypothetical country  
4. downloaded textures and set up different texture and made normals of textures using third party apps 
5. made country lines using multiple line objects . Made layers to put thing in it to make it organized
6. made countrylines through terrain through the countrylines shader but decided to use the standard shader with the emission feature
